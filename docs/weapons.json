Equipped with a main battleship-class cannon and two rotating turrets, as well as thick armor. The trade-off, however, is that all of these features add to its weight, making it a bit sluggish. Its main cannon is the EDF's state-of-the-art Requiem Gun, originally developed as a naval gun but then later equipped on tanks after reducing the size of its barrel. This has resulted in a further reduction to its initial velocity, so some skill is necessary to hit the desired target.\n \nThere are two sub-cannons (Howitzers) located on top of the main cannon. The main cannons and sub-cannons all rotate, and due to the location of the sub-cannons, the direction they face will change as the main cannon is rotated as well. There are also Grenade Dischargers equipped on both the left and right sides of the vehicle to halt any approaching creatures in their tracks.\n\nOnly Rangers and Air Raiders can pilot this vehicle, though anyone can ride in the gunners' seats.\n\nBefore you're permitted to use this, you'll need to earn a certain number of credits during the mission by defeating enemies. Your allies' kills will help contribute toward this as well.",

One of the EDF's trump cards, it makes up for its limited mobility with intensely powerful weaponry. Also has plate armor lining its body, giving it defensive capabilities greater than even that of most tanks. It can carry a large amount of ammo, too, making it akin to a walking fortress. The downside, however, is that there must be four people riding in it to make use of its full potential: one person takes on the role of pilot, while the others all function as gunners.\n\nOnly Rangers and Air Raiders can pilot this vehicle, though anyone can ride in the gunners' seats.\n\nBefore you're permitted to use this, you'll need to earn a certain number of credits during the mission by defeating enemies.

The rockets it fires have a homing feature in order to directly target specific foes, and they separate into small missiles in mid-flight to distribute their damage over as great an area as possible. Because the resulting missiles are small, their individual damage is minor, but the system is designed on the assumption that every last one of them will hit their target. And even when the enemy is moving at a high speed, at least one shot should always hit, meaning some damage will be dealt no matter what. When a target is within its sight, the weapon will automatically establish a positive lock, and it is entirely possible to lock on to several enemies at once. Press the attack button to fire when ready.\n\nBefore you're permitted to use this, you'll need to earn a certain number of credits during the mission by defeating enemies.

Basically a mobile fortress developed for land combat against the giant insects. Easily the strongest armament in the entirety of the EDF. Equipped with a main battleship-class cannon and two rotating turrets, as well as thick armor. The trade-off, however, is that all of these features add to its weight, making it a bit sluggish. Its main cannon is the EDF's state-of-the-art Requiem Gun, originally developed as a naval gun but then later equipped on tanks after reducing the size of its barrel. This has resulted in a further reduction to its initial velocity, so some skill is necessary to hit the desired target.\n \nThere are two sub-cannons located on top of the main cannon. The main cannons and sub-cannons all rotate, and due to the location of the sub-cannons, the direction they face will change as the main cannon is rotated as well. There are also Grenade Dischargers equipped on both the left and right sides of the vehicle to halt any approaching creatures in their tracks.\n\nOnly Rangers and Air Raiders can pilot this vehicle, though anyone can ride in the gunners' seats.\n\nBefore you're permitted to use this, you'll need to earn a certain number of credits during the mission by defeating enemies.

To make up for this shortcoming, it's been fitted with two machine guns on its rotating turret, which can be manned from either of the two gunner seats. Gunners should be aware, however, that the seats face whatever their respective turrets are aiming at. Since this vehicle needs to transport the electromagnetic railgun, its mobility and functionality alike are a bit lacking -- but compared to traditional weapons, its destructive power is excellent, and its armor level is quite high.\n\nOnly Rangers and Air Raiders can pilot this vehicle, though anyone can ride in the gunners' seats. \n\nBefore you're permitted to use this, you'll need to earn a certain number of credits during the mission by defeating enemies.
